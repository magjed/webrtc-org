The source code to <https://apprtc.appspot.com/> is now available at
<https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/webrtc/+/master/webrtc/examples/androidapp/src/org/appspot/apprtc>.

Our goal is to keep this app updated to work with the latest Chrome code and
to keep the code simple enough for everyone to use as an example or to simply
learn about WebRTC.

If you find bugs, feel free to send us a patch and we will commit it. We will
avoid adding to many features as simplicity and education is the goal here.

Hope this helps!
